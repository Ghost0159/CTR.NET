# CTR.NET
CTR (Nintendo 3DS) Library in C#, ported from pyctr

A "port" of pyctr in C#

My coding isn't the best, but "if it works, it works".

This came to be because I very much dislike python (no hate towards ihaveamac).

I will try to expand this library to support the most 3DS types, but I can't do everything as I'm not good enough of a dev.

Currently Suppported Types:

- CIA (General Information, Extacting Contents, Header Information, etc.
- NCSD (.3ds/.cci) General Information, Extracting Contents
- TMD (Title Metadata) General Information, Extensive Header Information, etc.
- Ticket (.tik, ticket.bin) General Information
- SMDH (icon.bin, icon.smdh) General Information, HOME Menu Options, etc.

Now has a Crypto Engine that is able to decrypt CIAs.
