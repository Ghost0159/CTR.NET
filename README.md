# CTR.NET
CTR (Nintendo 3DS) Library in C#, ported from pyctr

A "port" of pyctr in C#

My coding isn't the best, but "if it works, it works".

This came to be because I very much dislike python (no hate towards ihaveamac).

I will try to expand this library to support the most 3DS types, but I can't do everything as I'm not good enough of a dev.
